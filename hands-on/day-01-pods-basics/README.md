# Day 01 – Kubernetes Basics (Pods + YAML) ✅

Today I practiced Kubernetes hands-on using **KillerKoda Kubernetes Playground** (no local installation).
Goal: Learn the most important beginner concepts: **Cluster, Node, Pod, kubectl, YAML**.

---

## Tools Used
- **KillerKoda Kubernetes Playground** (ready cluster in browser)
- **kubectl** (Kubernetes command tool)
- **nginx image** (simple demo app)

---

## What I Practiced (Summary)
- Checked Kubernetes connection and cluster details
- Checked Nodes (machines)
- Checked Pods (apps)
- Created my first Pod using command
- Inspected Pod details
- Created Pod using YAML (real DevOps way)
- Deleted Pod (reproducible infra mindset)
- Checked logs
- Entered inside container using exec

---

## Commands I Used + Why I Used Them

### 1) Check kubectl and cluster connection
```bash
kubectl version --short
```

-To confirm kubectl is working and connected to Kubernetes cluster.
-Analogy: Before driving, you check the car key works.

```bash
kubectl cluster-info
```

-To verify the cluster is running and see control plane endpoints.

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```
-Nodes are the machines where Pods run.
-Ready means the machine is healthy and can run apps.
